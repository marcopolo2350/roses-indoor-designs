# Changelog

## 0.5.0-hardening.3 - 2026-04-26

- replaced a large shell/editor slice of inline `onclick` and `oninput` handlers with delegated `data-action` bindings
- bound the delegated UI action layer during boot so the home screen, editor chrome, 3D controls, and setup modal no longer depend on direct inline event wiring
