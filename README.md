# Rose Designs

Rose Designs is a browser-based room designer for planning, styling, and presenting interiors.

The app now runs as a small static app shell instead of one giant inlined page:
- `rose-designs.html` is the document shell
- `styles/app.css` holds the visual system
- `scripts/app.js` is the module bootstrap
- `scripts/state.js`, `scripts/storage.js`, `scripts/catalog.js`, `scripts/planner2d.js`, `scripts/planner3d.js`, `scripts/walkthrough.js`, `scripts/export.js`, and `scripts/ui.js` split the runtime into focused static modules
- `data/asset-manifest.json` is the source of truth for the catalog taxonomy, collections, and thumbnail wiring

It includes:
- 2D room drawing with walls, doors, windows, closets, partitions, and measurements
- local reference-image tracing in 2D with import, move, scale, opacity, lock, and calibration controls
- 3D room viewing with orbit and walk modes
- photo-focused 3D captures with `Photo Mode`, hero framing presets, and higher-quality PNG output
- richer lighting control with `Lighting Mood` plus a `Light Character` slider for daylight-to-evening scene shaping
- polished local walkthrough presets: `Dollhouse`, `Stroll`, `Corner Reveal`, `Before / After Flythrough`, and `Romantic Reveal`
- furniture placement with multi-select, copy/paste, snap-to-grid, and material variants
- premium catalog browsing with stronger category taxonomy, collection filters, favorites, recents, and real generated product thumbnails
- existing-room redesign planning with `keep / move / replace / remove`
- option-based redesign workflows with notes, thumbnails, and comparison views
- export tools for PNGs, comparison sheets, summary sheets, and client presentation PDFs

## Run Locally

This app is a static web app and works best when served over HTTP so 3D assets load correctly.

### Option 1: Python

```bash
python -m http.server 8123
```

Then open:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8123/
```

### Option 2: VS Code Live Server

Open the folder and serve it with any simple static server.

## Files

- `rose-designs.html` - document shell
- `styles/app.css` - extracted UI styling
- `scripts/app.js` - module bootstrap loader
- `scripts/state.js` - shared state and planner model helpers
- `scripts/storage.js` - IndexedDB/local profile persistence and catalog/storage utilities
- `scripts/catalog.js` - manifest-backed catalog, picker, variant selection, and furniture-side props
- `scripts/planner2d.js` - 2D plan rendering and editor interactions
- `scripts/planner2d.js` also owns the reference-overlay tracing workflow and calibration behavior
- `scripts/planner3d.js` - 3D scene, camera behavior, walkthrough presets, and photo mode / lighting polish
- `scripts/walkthrough.js` - emotional layer, self-test boot, and guided story behavior
- `scripts/thumbgen.html` - local thumbnail-render stage used to generate catalog previews
- `scripts/generate-thumbnails.mjs` - bulk thumbnail generator for the current asset catalog
- `scripts/export.js` - PNG, summary, comparison, and PDF export
- `scripts/ui.js` - home/editor shell behavior and compare state
- `data/asset-manifest.json` - structured asset metadata
- `assets/models/` - source GLB furniture and decor assets
- `assets/thumbnails/` - generated product thumbnails used by the catalog
- `package.json` - local Playwright dependency for QA
- `progress.md` - running development and verification log

## Notes

- The app stores rooms and editor state locally in the browser.
- For the best experience, use a modern Chromium-based browser.
- If 3D models do not appear, make sure you are not opening the file directly with `file://`.

## QA

The app includes a built-in self-test:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8123/rose-designs.html#selftest
```

## Thumbnail Pipeline

Generate or refresh the product thumbnails with:

```bash
node ./scripts/generate-thumbnails.mjs
```

This uses `scripts/thumbgen.html` as a consistent local render stage and writes PNGs into `assets/thumbnails/`.

## Current Highlights

- persistent undo/redo
- imperial and metric units
- local image-based floor-plan / room-photo tracing overlays with calibration and saved per-room state
- redesign options and client presentation export
- room comparison views in 2D and 3D
- stronger floor and furniture rendering for clearer visual contrast
- profile-aware local persistence for Rose and Marco
- collection-aware asset browsing with manifest-backed catalog metadata
- category-first premium picker with favorites, recents, collection chips, and real thumbnail cards
- manifest-driven product/material variants for major furniture, storage, rug, and lighting categories
- smoother 3D camera behavior with double-click focus and walkthrough presets
- photo mode with capture-oriented camera presets and cleaner presentation framing
- more cinematic 3D lighting with ACES tone mapping, better shadowing, and a daylight-to-evening light character control

## Reference Overlay Workflow

- import a local image as a floor-plan or room-photo reference
- reposition it directly on the 2D canvas
- adjust opacity and scale
- lock it so tracing/editing ignores the overlay
- calibrate it by clicking two points and entering a real-world distance

This pass is image-first. PDF import can be added later without changing the local-first architecture.
