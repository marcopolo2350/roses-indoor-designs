# Rose's Indoor Designs

Rose's Indoor Designs is a local-first browser app for planning, furnishing, reviewing, and presenting interior spaces in 2D and 3D.

This repo contains a real working app, but it is still in a transition phase between ambitious prototype and maintainable product. The goal of this README is to describe the repo honestly instead of treating every feature as equally mature.

## Live App

GitHub Pages serves the canonical app at:

```text
https://marcopolo2350.github.io/roses-indoor-designs/
```

## Current Status

### Stable enough to use

- 2D room drawing and editing
- local save/load in the browser
- multi-room projects with floor grouping
- catalog browsing and furniture placement
- room-to-room 3D viewing on the active floor
- image and PDF tracing overlays
- presentation exports and comparison sheets

### Working, but still fragile

- multi-room walkthrough behavior in very large projects
- 3D lighting presets and time-of-day tuning
- wall-mounted assets and some imported model pivots
- mobile editor ergonomics
- cloud sync

### Known architectural debt

- runtime still depends on ordered browser globals
- app boot uses sequential script injection instead of real `import` / `export`
- state is still shared through broad mutable globals
- runtime dependencies still load from pinned CDNs instead of a bundle
- large browser-global files still need gradual extraction

## Run Locally

The app should be served over HTTP so local assets, 3D models, and PDF helpers load correctly.

### Recommended

```bash
npm run dev
```

Then open:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8123/
```

### Alternate port

```bash
npm run dev:alt
```

Then open:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8124/
```

## Package Scripts

```bash
npm run dev
npm run dev:alt
npm run check
npm run lint
npm run format
npm run validate:manifest
npm run validate:asset-sizes
npm run validate:asset-sources
npm run validate:static-a11y

- `test:smoke` - starts a temporary local server and runs the Playwright smoke helper against the app
- `test` - runs syntax, lint, format, validation commands, and the built-in self-test
- `thumbs` - regenerates catalog thumbnails
- `clean` - clears ignored smoke-test, self-test, and temporary debug output artifacts

## QA

Built-in self-test:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8123/index.html#selftest
```

Notes:

- the repo now includes reproducible `test:self`, `test:smoke`, and manifest-validation commands
- the repo has a starter Playwright spec suite, but not full workflow coverage yet
- `progress.md` is still the best source for recent verification history

## Thumbnail Pipeline

Regenerate catalog thumbnails with:

```bash
npm run thumbs
```

The thumbnail tool renders from [scripts/thumbgen.html](./scripts/thumbgen.html) into [assets/thumbnails](./assets/thumbnails).

## Local-First Notes

- projects and editor state live in the browser
- most workflows are designed to work without a backend
- cloud sync is optional and still a lower-confidence surface than local editing

## Architecture Reality Check

The runtime is split across files, but it is not yet a clean ES-module architecture. Today it boots through [scripts/main.js](./scripts/main.js), which is an explicit ES-module entrypoint that still uses a documented compatibility bridge to load the existing browser-global runtime. That bridge is temporary and intentional. The repo now also has first-pass central surfaces for runtime state and history in [scripts/core/app-state.js](./scripts/core/app-state.js) and [scripts/core/history.js](./scripts/core/history.js), but most feature code has not been migrated onto them yet.

If you are trying to contribute or extend this app, treat it like a capable but still consolidating codebase:

- prefer small, verified changes
- expect some cross-file coupling
- check `progress.md` before assuming a subsystem is stable
- read the refactor roadmap before adding big new feature surfaces
