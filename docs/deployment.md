# Deployment

## GitHub Pages

The app remains GitHub Pages compatible.

- canonical entrypoint: `index.html`
- no redirect-only HTML entrypoints are kept in the repo
- published URL: `https://marcopolo2350.github.io/roses-indoor-designs/`

## Local preview

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Runtime dependency note

The app still depends on CDN-hosted runtime libraries for Three.js, jsPDF, and pdf.js. That is a known hardening debt, not a solved problem.
